I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

- My research interests lie within the intersection of data management, stream processing, and distributed systems.
- I'm passionate about building data-intensive systems using Rust!
- I'm currently working on [µWheel](https://github.com/uwheel/uwheel), an embeddable aggregate management system for unified stream analytics and adhoc queries.
- I'm also a TA in Advanced Distributed Systems and Introduction to Databases at KTH.
