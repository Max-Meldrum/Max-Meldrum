Hi There!

- My interests lie within the intersection of data management, stream processing, and distributed systems.
- I'm passionate about building data-intensive systems.
- Creator of [ÂµWheel](https://github.com/uwheel/uwheel), an embeddable aggregate management system for unified stream analytics and adhoc queries.
- I'm currently working on [datafusion-uwheel](https://github.com/uwheel/datafusion-uwheel), a native DataFusion optimizer for time-based analytics.
