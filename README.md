I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

- My research interests lie within the intersection of data management, stream processing, and distributed systems.
- I'm passionate about building data-intensive systems!
	- Preferred Language => Rust
	- Preferred OS => Linux
- I'm currently working on an embeddable temporal analytical database that is heavily influenced by stream processing semantics.
- I'm also a TA in Advanced Distributed Systems and Introduction to Databases at KTH.
